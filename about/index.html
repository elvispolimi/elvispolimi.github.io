He received his Master of Science degree in Electronic Engineering, in 2002, and the PhD degree in Computer Engineering, in 2006, from Politecnico di Milano (Italy). He is currently a Full Professor at the Department of Electronics, Information, and Bioengineering (DEIB) at the same University. Previously, he was part of the Low-Power Design Group of AST - STMicroelectronics working on Network-on-Chip architectures, and a Research Assistant at the Advanced Learning and Research Institute (ALaRI) of the Universita' della Svizzera Italiana. His research interests include design methodologies and architectures for embedded and HPC systems focusing on autotuning aspects. Since 2003, he published more than 100 scientific papers in peer-reviewed conferences and journals.
