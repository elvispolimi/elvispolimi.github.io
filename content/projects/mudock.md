In our laboratory we are the main mantainers and developers of LiGen, part of the [EXSCALATE](https://exscalate.com/) platform.
LiGen is an extreme-scale high-throughput virtual screening application for drug discovery that aims at estimating the interaction strenght between a ligand, i.e. a candidate drug, and a protein that represents the disease.
To enable fast prototyping and evaluating new technologies, we also written a small miniapp based on autodock named [muDock](https://github.com/elvispolimi/muDock).

The goal of this project is to port and evaluate one of the two kernels that compose the application.
The project involves mainly interaction with high-end NVIDIA GPUs, which we can provide access, along with free courses and certifications from NVIDIA [DLI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/).
Also, the analysis and research of performance portability using other tools like SYCL or HIP can be an option.
