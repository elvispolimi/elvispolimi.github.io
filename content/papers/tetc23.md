## EXSCALATE: An Extreme-Scale Virtual Screening Platform for Drug Discovery Targeting Polypharmacology to Fight SARS-CoV-2

The social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic demands a reduction of the time required to find a therapeutic cure. In this paper, we describe the EXSCALATE molecular docking platform capable to scale on an entire modern supercomputer for supporting extreme-scale virtual screening campaigns. Such virtual experiments can provide in short time information on which molecules to consider in the next stages of the drug discovery pipeline, and it is a key asset in case of a pandemic. The EXSCALATE platform has been designed to benefit from heterogeneous computation nodes and to reduce scaling issues. In particular, we maximized the acceleratorsâ€™ usage, minimized the communications between nodes, and aggregated the I/O requests to serve them more efficiently. Moreover, we balanced the computation across the nodes by designing an ad-hoc workflow based on the execution time prediction of each molecule. We deployed the platform on two HPC supercomputers, with a combined computational power of 81 PFLOPS, to evaluate the interaction between 70 billion of small molecules and 15 binding-sites of 12 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The experiment lasted 60 hours and it performed more than one trillion ligand-pocket evaluations, setting a new record on the
