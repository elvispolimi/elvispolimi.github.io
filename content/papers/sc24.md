## Out of kernel tuning and optimizations for portable large-scale docking experiments on GPUs

Virtual screening is an early stage in the drug discovery process that selects the most promising candidates. In the urgent computing scenario, finding a solution in the shortest time frame is critical. Any improvement in the performance of a virtual screening application translates into an increase in the number of candidates evaluated, thereby raising the probability of finding a drug. In this paper, we show how we can improve application throughput using Out-of-kernel optimizations. They use input features, kernel requirements, and architectural features to rearrange the kernel inputs, executing them out of order, to improve the computation efficiency. These optimizationsâ€™ implementations are designed on an extreme-scale virtual screening application, named LiGen, that can hinge on CUDA and SYCL kernels to carry out the computation on modern supercomputer nodes. Even if they are tailored to a single application, they might also be of interest for applications that share a similar design pattern. The experimental results show how these optimizations can increase kernel performance by 2 X, respectively, up to 2.2X in CUDA and up to 1.9X, in SYCL. Moreover, the reported speedup can be achieved with the best-proposed parameterization, as shown by the data we collected and reported in this manuscript.
